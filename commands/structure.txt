We **strongly** suggest you using the following folder structure.
This allows you to easily update or downgrade the artifact without messing with your base files.
```
📁C:/.../Desktop/FiveM-server
├── 📁txData (created automatically)
├── 📁<artifact number>
│   └── 📦FXServer.exe
└── 📁<server name>
    ├── 📁resources
    └── 📝server.cfg
```
This folder structure doesn't need to be in your Desktop.
If your username has spaces or special characters then you need to put it on `C:/`.

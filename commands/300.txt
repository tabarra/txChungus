In 5 minutes I can fully cook an Instant Cup Of Noodles :ramen: and eat half of it, yet your server can't even start!
You for sure:
a) Have way too many resources. You know all those oversize asset warnings? yeah that's a thing.
b) Have some slow-loading resources like Chocohax.
c) Have a slow CPU.
Do not try to change txAdmin, please fix YOUR server.
